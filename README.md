Oversimplified Number Randomizing Machine.

*Despite it's name, it's really simple*

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

The name says it all - randomizer with configurable range.

It's my first project that was made with C# and Silverlight
